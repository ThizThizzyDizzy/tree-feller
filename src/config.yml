# Format:  prefix-<option name>-suffix: "<text>"
# Valid prefixes are:
# debug        This is the message used when debug mode is on
# actionbar    This will be sent to the player's actionbar
# chat         This will be sent to the player in the chat
# Valid suffixes are:
# <no suffix>  This defines what message is sent when this option's global requirement is not met

# -tree        This defines what message is sent when a tree requirement is not met
# -success     This defines what message is sent when global, tree, and tool requirements for are all met
# In addition to the options, there are a few additional messages that can be customized:
# toggle           This is sent when the player cuts down a tree when the tree feller is off
# checking         This is sent for each tree/tool pair the tree feller checks
# durability-low   This is sent when the tool's durability is too low to fell the tree
# partial          This is sent when a tree is being partially cut
# protected        This is sent when a tree cannot be felled due to a protection plugin (This may be on top of that plugin's protected message)
# success          This is sent when a tree is successfully felled
