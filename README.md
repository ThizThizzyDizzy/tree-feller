Thizzy'z Tree Feller Bukkit plugin for Minecraft 1.13+

When an axe is used to cut down a tree, the whole tree will be cut down at once.

This tree feller is extremely highly customizable. (Everything is explained in the config)

## You can:
- Tell the plugin what counts as a tree, such as a birch and oak wood trunk with jungle leaves
- Tell the plugin what counts as a tool, with a lot of requirements, such as minimum and maximum durability, required and banned enchantments, and more!
- Customize every aspect of the tree feller for individual tools and trees
- And so much more!

## Building

Gradle is the recommended way to build the project. Use `gradlew build` in the main project directory to build the project.
